  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
Welcome to my little corner of creativity.  
Each sketch and stroke you see here is a piece of my thoughts,  
my emotions, and the stories I cannot always put into words.  
</p>

<p>
I believe art is not just about colors or lines,  
but about capturing moments, feelings, and quiet beauty.  
Through my work, I hope to share simplicity, peace,  
and a touch of imagination with you.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for visiting my gallery.  
Your presence here makes the art come alive. ðŸŒ¿
